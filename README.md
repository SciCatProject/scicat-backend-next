# IMPORTANT!!!!

**As of 2023/06/15, this repository holds the official version of SciCat backend**
This is the only version that is officially supported. It is commonly referred to as backend, BE, v4.x or a combination of them.

You can find the old backend (v3.x, loopback implementation) at (https://github.com/SciCatProject/backend).
The repo for backend v3.x is archived and read-only

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any member of the development team,
or the SciCat team at ESS.

## Contributing

If you're planning to contribute to this project by adding new functionality, we encourage you to discuss it first in the Discussions tab. This helps ensure that your proposed changes align with the project's goals and prevents duplicate efforts. Here's how you can initiate a discussion:

1. Go to the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next/discussions).
2. Start a new discussion thread outlining your proposed changes.
3. Wait for feedback and consensus before proceeding with creating a pull request.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project!

## Get started

1. `git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next.git`
2. `npm install`
3. Add _.env_ file to project root folder. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables).
4. _Optional_ Add [functionalAccounts.json](#local-user-accounts) file to project root folder to create local users.
5. _Optional_ Add [loggers.json](#loggers-configuration) file to the root folder and configure multiple loggers.
6. `npm run start:dev`
7. Go to http://localhost:3000/explorer to get an overview of available endpoints and database schemas.
8. To be able to run the e2e tests with the same setup as in the Github actions you will need to run `npm run  prepare:local` and after that run `npm run start:dev`. This will start all needed containers and copy some configuration to the right place.

## Develop in a container using the docker-compose.dev file

1. `git clone https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next.git`
2. docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
3. _Optional_ Mount [functionalAccounts.json](#local-user-accounts) file to a volume in the container to create local users.
4. _Optional_ Mount [loggers.json](#loggers-configuration) file to a volume in the container to configure multiple loggers.
5. _Optional_ change the container env variables
6. Attach to the container
7. `npm run start:dev`
8. Go to http://localhost:3000/explorer to get an overview of available endpoints and database schemas.

## Test the app

1. **Running the unit tests:** `npm run test`
2. **Running the e2e(api) tests:**

- First of all run `npm run prepare:local` to prepare the local environment for starting
- After that run `npm run test:api` which will start the backend locally and run both `jest` and `mocha` e2e(api) tests.
- [Optional] If you want to run only the mocha tests you will need to start the backend locally with `npm run start` and then use `npm run test:api:mocha`
- [Optional] If you want to run only the jest tests you can use `npm run test:api:jest`

## Configuration

There are multiple ways to configure your SciCat instance.

In order to configure a SciCat instance run on barebone OS, there are three options:

1. Edit directly the file `src/config/configuration.ts`
2. Create a `.env` file with your local value of the variables listed in the next session. Only the variables that are required by your installation should be defined. To create your `.env` file, you can copy and edit the sample `.env.example` provided with in code
3. Define in your environment all the necessary variables (list provided below), prior running SciCat.

If SciCat runs in a containeraized environment, like docker or kubernetes, you can run the release image and specify your configuration using one of the following two methods:

1. create `.env` and mount it directly in your container.
2. define the necessary environment variables directly in your container.

More information are provided in the official documentation.

### Local User Accounts

Providing a file called _functionalAccounts.json_ at the root of the project, locally or in the container, will
automatically create the specified accounts on startup. If this file is not provided, no local users will be created.

Follow the structure of [functionalAccounts.json.minimal.example](/functionalAccounts.json.minimal.example) to create
your own _functionalAccounts.json_ file.

### Loggers configuration

Providing a file called _loggers.json_ at the root of the project, locally or in the container, and create an external logger class in the `src/loggers/loggingProviders/`directory will automatically create specified one or multiple loggers instances.

The `loggers.json.example` file in the root directory showcases the example of configuration structure for the one or multiple loggers. `logger.service.ts` file contains the configuration handling process logic, and `src/loggers/loggingProviders/grayLogger.ts` includes actual usecase of grayLogger.

## Migrating from the old SciCat Backend

Where the [current SciCat Backend](https://github.com/SciCatProject/backend) accepts id fields in the database named `pid`, `doi`, or similar, this implementation requires there to be an id field of the form `_id` on every document. It is therefore necessary to run a database migration script towards MongoDB instance from a place where you have access to it and can install `migrate-mongo` package.

All database [migration scripts](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next/tree/master/migrations) located in the [migrations](/migrations/) folder. To start the migration use:

```sh
npm run migrate:db:up
```

For down migration use:

```sh
npm run migrate:db:down
```

For listing applied DB migrations:

```sh
npm run migrate:db:status
```
